of the best investment plans that will help fulfil your dreams.

<p>
We always find measures to multiply our money. The best way to manage your
finances is by saving and investing a part of your income for future goals. The
most efficient and smart way to multiply your money is by investing in a short
term plan or a long term plan based on our goals. A short term plan refers to a
period of 1-5 years also known as short-term investments. A long term plan
refers to more than 5 years also known as a long term plan. Both the plans have
their advantages such as in short term investment money is not locked in for a
long duration and short term goals like buying a car/bike, short vacation etc,
can be accomplished using the investment returns. Whereas long term plans are
risk-free and give greater returns to accomplish long term goals like higher
education, purchasing a house, etc.

the best investment options available in the market.

<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 mb-2 mt2">
<h4>Equity Mutual Funds</h4>
<p>
Equity mutual funds are a type of mutual fund wherein the investments are made in stocks
or shares of the company. Equity funds are of two types i.e., Active or Passive. In
Active Mutual Funds, the performance of the company and thorough research of the market
is done by the fund manager before investing and invests in the best stocks. At Passive
mutual funds, the fund manager invests in popular and standard stocks say Nifty 50 or
Sensex. Equity is further divided based on Market Capitalisation as Small cap, Mid cap
or Large-cap funds.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 mb-2 mt2">
<h4>Direct Equity</h4>
<p>
Direct equity refers to purchasing stocks from the stock market. This investment is
subject to market risk. Investing in stocks requires certain skill and knowledge, to
choose the right stock. This plan delivers high returns than any other investment when
used as a long term investment. But there are also chances of prices falling. When a
person chooses this investment plan he/she should be wise enough to manage risk
management by keeping a stop loss. Keeping a stop loss and target will help to prevent
heavy loss in the stock market.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 mb-2 mt2">
<h4>Unit Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs)</h4>
<p>
ULIPs is an investment plan that has two parts i.e. the investment part and the
insurance part. In this type of plan, the insurer invests a part of the premium in
shares and the remaining amount is utilized in giving a life insurance cover. The fund
managers track and manage the investment part so the investor is saved from tracking the
investment. Though ULIP is an investment as well as an insurance product, one should
treat it as an investment product.

<h2>
Buying Investment Plan
</h2><h6 class="text-blue"> Investment plans make your dream come true!</h6>
<p>
With a new job in hand or you are entering into a role of parenthood, you must be all
prepped up to meet the upcoming responsibilities and challenges! A sound investment plan
will give you a happy and secure future.<br />
Having an investment plan in our portfolio makes us a more systematic and disciplined
approach towards savings, thereby building a corpus of funds and a lifetime of financial
security.<br />
The first and foremost benefit of Investment Plans is that they help multiply the money
that will sit idle and ensure that you lead a healthy and fulfilling life.<br />
Here are some of the benefits of Investment Plans:
</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1">
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Generate Income</h3>
<p>
The greatest advantage of investment is that various avenues offer
attractive discounts to earn some extra income in the form of bonuses
(guaranteed & non-guaranteed), dividends, interests, and much more. You
can easily earn capital gains from the sale of equities, debts, mutual
funds, and even real estate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Planning Based On Your Dream</h3>
<p>
As discussed earlier, it is wise to choose a plan according to our
purpose in life. For instance, short term goals like buying a car, or a
bike, etc, will require a different sort of investment. For long term
dreams like purchasing a house, higher education, marriage, etc, require
long term investment planning with substantial returns.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Avail Tax Benefits</h3>
<p>
Most of the plans like PPF, ULIP, Sukanya Samridhi Yojana, etc, bring
with them an array of tax benefits. The premiums paid for life insurance
policies are covered under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, the
maturity/death benefits are also tax-free under Section 10(10D). Thus an
investment plan not only gives returns but also provide tax saving
benefits.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Substantial Accumulation of Future Wealth</h3>
<p>
A sound and solid investment plan is the key to wealth creation. Savings
and investment go hand in hand and is the best way to multiply your
sleeping funds. Investing in the right plan can help you to create
substantial wealth for a secured future.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Protection Against Risks</h3>
<p>
Life is uncertain and we never know what is in stock for us tomorrow!
For such emergencies, an investment plan that provides life cover along
with return on investment will work as a safety net in financial terms.
This will allow a person to be prepared and protect himself and his
family from unpredictable situations.<br>
A seed of investment can grow big and help nurture your dreams into a
beautiful reality!<br>
Nevertheless, before diving into a conclusion, it is advisable to
compare investment plans with insurejoy.com, to truly enjoy the benefits
of investment

<h2>Formula to Double Your Investment</h2>
<p>
Time, patience and perseverance is the key mantra to double your investment. There is no
such plan that can double your investment overnight. With smart investment and some
amount of time, the money can see substantial growth.
</p>
<p>
There is a formula to calculate the amount of time that the investment will take to
double the money.
</p>
<p>Rule of 72 is the formula that many investors use to calculate the amount of time.</p>
<p>Time to double the money = 72 / rate of interest</p>
<p>
Example: Raju chooses to invest Rs. 10,000 in Mutual Funds and the average rate of
interest is 8%.
</p>
<p>So the time taken to double the money will be = 72/8 = 9 years.</p>

<h5 class=" sectiontitle ">How to Choose </h5>
<h2>Your Ideal Investment Plan</h2>
<p>
insurejoy.com will guide you to choose your ideal investment plan. Certain factors have
to be kept in mind before choosing the right plan. Rather than just relying on benefits
various other factors have to be considered.
</p>
<div class="featureblock">
<div class="reasonst num">1</div>
<div class="featurest">
<h4>Set Your Goal </h4>
<p>
Goal-setting helps you to determine the time frame required to achieve that goal.
It is easier to choose a plan when you understand the time required to fulfil
your dream requires a short term plan or a long term plan. According to experts,
a long term investment will give you more benefits.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="featurest">
<h4>Selecting a Reputed Company</h4>
<p>
It is vital that choose an investment option from a reputed organisation that has
a good brand image. This will create confidence that the invested money will
stay safe.

<h4>Death Benefits</h4>

If you are investing in term insurance online death choose a plan that provides
maximum death benefit so that your family doesn’t suffer in your absence.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="featureblock">
<div class="reasonst num">4</div>
<div class="featurest">
<h4>Flexibility to Withdraw Money</h4>
<p>
It is best to select a plan that has a partial withdrawal option. What is the use
of creating wealth if you cannot access it when needed? Select a plan that gives
you the freedom to withdraw money.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="featureblock">
<div class="reasonst num">5</div>
<div class="featurest">
<h4>Risk Management</h4>
<p>
Risk management is an absolute necessity when you invest in mutual funds or the
stock market. You have to first decide the amount of risk that you can bear.
Then multiply that risk number by 15. So, the amount of loss that you can bear
after losing 15 trades is your risk rupee. Example: You invest Rs.100000 in
Mutual Funds or stocks. The risk you are ready to take per trade is Rs. 1000 so
15x1000= 15,000. So, your risk rupee is Rs. 15,000. Choose a plan with a
low-risk profile if you are not willing to lose any money.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="featureblock">
<div class="reasonst num">6</div>
<div class="featurest">
<h4>Diverse Investment</h4>
<p>
Instead of investing all your money in a single plan choose to diversify your
portfolio. Invest in insurance plans, mutual funds, Fixed deposits, etc.
Diversifying the investment portfolio will balance the risk profile.

<h5 class=" sectiontitle "> Expert’s Tips </h5>
<h2>
To Imply Before Investing in a Plan
</h2>
<p>
Here are some tips from our experts that should be kept in mind before investing in a
plan.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Sooner the Better </span> Age is the biggest factor to consider before fund planning. Early bird gets the
catch is true when it comes to investment. Set your goals at a young age and start
investing at an early age. The number of years wasted is equal to the money you
waste. Design your investment portfolio now.
</li>
<li>
<span>
Proper Planning
</span> of your income has to be made. Your monthly income can be dispersed
as 30% for loan instalments, 30% must go towards investments (savings). The
investment has to be diversified in various funds. Never invest in just one scheme.
This can be achieved by scheduling a SIP to automate this habit. The rest 40% of
your monthly expense can be used for your living expenses.
</li>
<li>
<span>Plan According Your Debts</span>
If you have any car loan, a house loan, an education loan or any other debt consider
investing in a scheme based on the loan payback years.
</li>
<li>
<span>Invest In Your Future Income</span> It is best to invest in a plan that can replace your monthly income in unforeseen
situations For example if you are earning 20 lakh per annum then invest in a scheme
that brings the benefit of at least 15 to 18 lakh per annum, in case you suffer a
permanent or partial physical disability and are not able to earn.
</li>
<li>
<span>Invest To Make Your Life Milestones Memorable </span> Plan to save for your important milestones in life marriage, higher education, or
unforeseen events like critical illness treatment for self or parents. Investing in
a plan with flexible withdrawal at the system is best.
</li>
<li>
<span>Enquire About The Benefits </span> If you are already having a group policy provided by your company, then you must
enquire about the benefits you will be getting from that policy so that you can
exclude those benefits out while investing in a scheme, and look for other major
benefits.
</li>
<li>
<span>Invest Wisely </span>
If you have an income source coming from any other family member like your spouse
and the expenses are being met by their income then it cannot be a part of your
saving plan. If your family or spouse has invested in any plan then the benefits you
receive should be considered before allocating a fund for investment.
</li>
<li>
<span>Calculate & Plan your Premiums </span>
A premium calculator will help you analyse the exact requirement of a saving plan
and the premium amount you need to pay for the scheme. This is an extremely useful
tool that comes in handy to determine your outflow and inflow of funds.
