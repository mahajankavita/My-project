<h5 class="sectiontitle">Important Points to Consider</h5>
<h2>
Before Purchasing a Health Insurance Plan
</h2>
<p> There are more than 200 insurance policies available in the market. It might be a bit overwhelming with so many options available in hand, but it is important to choose a plan by considering certain factors. </p>
<div class="elementcontainer1 mt-3">
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Sum Insured Amount</h4>
<p> It is important to choose a plan that has adequate coverage. Keeping in mind the rising inflation maximum sum insured has to be chosen. Choosing a higher sum insured will give you better coverage and benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Check on the Policy Benefits</h4>
<p> Every policy has certain unique benefits. It is better to research the scope of benefits that you can avail yourself of through your policy. Certain benefits that you can look for is daily cash, COVID cover, hospitalisation treatment expense, critical lines cover, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Choose based on Policy Types</h4>
<p> There are different types of policy available like the individual policy, family floater policy, senior citizen policy, women's policy, top-up policy, etc. Choose the type of policy that you require.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Inform of any Pre-Existing Diseases</h4>
<p> Keep your insurer informed about any pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Waiting Period</h4>
<p>The health insurance policy is activated only after the waiting period is over. Keep track of the waiting period, since any claims made during the waiting period is not applicable. Certain diseases like blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid, etc, will have a waiting period clause. It is best to choose a plan with a minimal waiting period.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Co-Payment Clause</h4>
<p>Certain plans require co-payment, i.e., the expenses will be borne by the insurance and the policyholder. Read the clause of the policy carefully before purchasing the scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Network Hospital with Cashless Benefit</h4>
<p>Before purchasing a plan it is best to check the list of network hospitals available. Make sure the network hospitals provides cashless benefit and are in your vicinity. </p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Life-Long Renewability Option</h4>
<p>Make sure to opt for the lifelong renewability option so that the insurance can be renewed every year. </p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Claim Settlement Ratio</h4>
<p>The claim settlement ratio is an important factor to consider. An insurance company with an 80% and above claim settlement ratio is considered to be the best option.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Additional Loading Charges</h4>
<p>Certain plans have premium loading charges that are additional amounts is charged in the premium especially in the senior citizen plan. It is best to opt for health insurance that does not have any loading charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-2 mt-2">
<h4>Early Investing</h4>
<p>It is better to get insured at an early age, to reduce the premium rates.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="sectiontitle">Documents Required</h5>
<h2>

<h5 class="sectiontitle">Health Insurance Renewal</h5>
<h2>
What is Health Insurance Portability?
</h2>
<p> Renewing your Health Insurance is very important just as you renew your vehicle insurance every
year. If a policyholder fails to renew within the expiry date he/she will be provided a grace period
of 30 days. But any claim during this 30 day grace period will not be allowed.
The policyholder has to renew the health insurance policy within the grace period. If an individual
fails to renew even during the grace period, then the policyholder will lose the insurance and its
benefits like no claim bonus, waiting period, etc. </p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="sectiontitle">In case of claim</h5>
<h2>
What Types of Claim Procedures Are Available?
</h2>
<p>A policyholder has two options when it comes to claiming settlement i.e. cashless claim settlement and reimbursement claim settlement procedures. Both the claim settlement methods provided by the health insurance company are easy and quick.</p>
<div class="col-sm-12 nopad-left nopad-right">
<h4>Reimbursement Claim Procedure</h4>
<p> If the policyholder opts to get treatment in a non-network hospital then the individual is eligible for reimbursement claim procedure. In this method, the policyholder has to pay the hospital expenses first and then later you can file a claim for reimbursement of the money. Once you submit the necessary documents, medical records and medical bills to the insurance company they would approve the process and the money will be credited to your bank account. </p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-12 nopad-left nopad-right">
<h4>Cashless Claim Procedure</h4>
<p> Cashless benefits can be availed if you prefer to get treatment in the network hospital. This type of benefit is available only in-network hospitals where you do not have to pay the medical bills. For the cashless claim settlement process, you just have to show the health card provided by the insurer and fill out certain forms. Once the insurance company approves the process the medical bills will be directly settled by the insurance company to the network hospital. </p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-12 nopad-left nopad-right">
<h4>Health Card</h4>
<p> Every insurance company provides a health card to their customers. This card can be used to avail cashless benefits at network hospitals. In case of emergency hospitalisation treatments like accidents, the health card should be provided in the network hospital along with a pre-authorization letter. The insurance company will verify and approve the process for cashless benefits.</p>
<p>In the case of a planned surgery in a network hospital, the claim settlement is easy and simple. You just have to show the health card provided by the insurance company and fill out the pre-authorisation form. After verifying the forms the insurance company will approve the cashless benefit claim process.</p>
