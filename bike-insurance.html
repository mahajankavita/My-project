<div class="felement">
<h3>
Things to do Before the Policy Expires
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your policy is about to expire contact your insurer and learn about the premium amount. The premium amount differs every year. Also, discuss the required documents needed for renewal and arrange for an agent to meet and collect the information from you </li>
<li>Alternatively, you can save your time by logging in to the insurer&rsquo;s website to check the information </li>
<li>If you wish to select any add-ons you can prefer to add them to your portfolio while renewing the policy </li>
<li>The premium amount payment can be made through cash or cheque while opting for offline mode. But, if you are buying it online, just make instant payment through net banking and get the policy renewed immediately </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="felement">
<h3>Things to do After the Policy Expires <div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>You need not worry even after the policy has expired as you still have a small time frame, called a grace period, to get it renewed. The grace period is usually from 15 to 30 days after the expiry date but, not every insurer offers this period. Some insurers may offer renewal for free during this period and but, some may incur levy charges. The following steps have to be followed if your policy lies within grace period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if there is any late fee incurred and if any, make that payment </li>
<li>Try to clear all past dues and pending premiums </li>
<li>Choose the policy you want to buy and select any add-ons you want to add to your renewed policy </li>
<li>Furnish the details and submit the required documents to the insurer. You can make the payment either through an online transaction or through an agent and the renewed policy will be delivered to you </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="felement">
<h3>
Renewal Outside Grace Period

<h2>
Two-Wheeler Insurance Premium
</h2>
<p>
With a little bit of smartness, you can cut down your two-wheeler insurance cost! <br>
<strong>insurejoy.com has some important tips to share with you:</strong>
</p>
<div class="smsection1 mt-4">
<h4>Purchase Insurance Policy Online</h4>
<ul>
<li>This saves your time and effort. You don&rsquo;t have to pay commission to insurance agents. It is a simple and cost-effective way to reduce the bike insurance premium </li>
<li>The advantage of the online process is that the insurance provider does not have to pay for maintaining infrastructure, giving commission to their sales agents and other overheads. Thus these savings are passed on to you in the form of lower premiums. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="smsection1">
<h4>Avoid Making Small Claims</h4>
<ul>
<li>Filing claims for every little damage may save your money, but at the time of renewal, the premium goes up. The reason is the insurers will start considering you a high-risk customer and will charge you a high premium. </li>
<li>If you file a claim the discount on premium in the form of No Claim Bonus (NCB) will be lost at the time of renewal of the policy. The NCB starts at 20% for the first claim-free year and will go up to a maximum of 50%. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="smsection1">
<h4>Renew on Time</h4>
<p>Renewing the insurance cover on time can help you save money</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be charged with fines and penalties if you don&rsquo;t renew the policy on time. </li>
<li>If the policy has expired and hasn&rsquo;t been renewed even during the grace period you might have to buy an entirely new policy that will attract a higher premium. </li>
<li>Without a proper insurance policy driving on road is illegal and you will have to pay a fine to the government. Save money by renewing on time. </li>
<li>The major risk you have to face is if your vehicle meets with an accident after your policy gets expired. The insurer will not provide financial assistance. The entire expense will have to be paid by you! </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="smsection1">

<h5 class=" sectiontitle "> Factors That Affect</h5>
<h2>Your Bike Insurance Premium</h2>
<p>Certain factors affect the premium of your two-wheeler insurance policy which is discussed below: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Bike Model</h4>
<p>A high-end expensive bike will attract a higher premium compared to an economical bike. The premiums are based on three categories for bikes when it comes to their cc: 0-150cc, 150-350cc and above 350cc. The premium amount rises as the cc goes up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Manufacture Year of the Bike</h4>
<p>The cost of repair and damages for the new bikes is higher as the parts is going to be expensive. So the newer bike has a high premium. New bikes have higher Insured Declared Value (IDV), so at the time of reimbursement, a higher amount has to be settled in case of accident or theft. However, older bikes have lesser IDV and thereby attract lower premiums. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>No Claim Bonus</h4>
<p>If you do not file for any claims in a single year you are eligible for a No Claim Bonus (NCB) in the following year. The NCB discounts start from 10% and go up to 50% on the premium. You can also transfer your NCB from one policy to another! </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Your Township</h4>
<p>If you live in an urban and densely populated area you will attract a higher premium since the chances of any mishap/accident are higher. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Insurance Type</h4>
<p>A third-party insurance cover is cheap compared to a comprehensive bike insurance policy. This is because comprehensive insurance provides extensive financial coverage with additional benefits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Anti-theft Safety Discount</h4>
<p>
If an ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) approved an anti-theft device fitted in your bike, then you can enjoy discounts on premium.<br>
At insurejoy.com, you can key in all the factors and reach the best premium value as per your needs, in just a few clicks!

<h2>
Bike Insurance - Online Vs. Offline Comparison!
</h2>
<p>
The bike insurance policy can be bought either offline i.e. from an insurance agent or through online mode. But recently more and more people prefer buying it online and there are valid reasons for the same. <br>
<strong>Let us show you the comparison between the two modes based on the following factors: </strong>
</p>
<ol class="elementcontainer1">
<li>
<h4> Convenience </h4>
<p> Instead of going to an insurance office directly or calling an insurance agent home, you can look at various insurance plans easily online. Just do some research, compare various plans and purchase a policy at your convenience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Cost</h4>
<p>You can notice that every insurance company can offer you attractive deals and offers for a discounted premium. The reason behind this is if you buy a policy online they don’t have to worry about the agent’s commissions and other overhead costs. Hence, buying insurance online means extremely lower premiums!</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Better Information</h4>
<p>Purchasing a bike insurance cover online allows you a chance to gather detailed information about each product so you can make an informed decision as compared to check with an agent, who might not share complete details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Simple Payments</h4>
<p>The online payment transaction is much faster and easy when compared to an offline mode where a cheque has to be written and wait for payments to clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Customer Service</h4>
<p>Every insurance company has a 24*7 customer care center where you can speak with a representative over the phone to solve any query or doubt while purchasing the policy rather than personally visiting their office in case you decide to buy offline!</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4> Secure</h4>
<p>The online mode is completely safe as the entire process of selecting, comparing, buying and paying for the policy is secure and your personal information is kept confidential</p>
</li>
