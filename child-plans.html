<h5 class=" sectiontitle "> Understanding the Concept </h5>
<h2>
Child Savings Plan vs Child Education Plan
</h2>
<p> A Child Plan is a child-centric insurance plan that acts as a financial tool to secure the future of your child and makes sure that the child does not face any financial insecurities when you are not around.</p>
<h3>Child Savings Plan<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>A Child Savings Plan may be an insurance plan or child endowment plan or money back plan or ULIP plan that helps generate a corpus amount for your child’s future. This plan gives good returns if invested for the long term. The plan can be pre-defined as per your needs for instance for higher education or marriage. Since it is a life insurance product it ensures to take care of the financial needs of the child and acts as a life cover in case of demise of the policyholder.</p>
<h3>Child Education Plan<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>Now a Child Education Plan is a blend of both investment and insurance. It has double benefits of life insurance cum-investment like ULIP or Endowment Plan that help to generate a corpus for the child. On maturity, these plans provide a lump sum amount that can be used at important milestones of life like education fees and marriage expenses.</p>

<h5 class=" sectiontitle "> How It Works? </h5>
<h2>
Understanding the Working of Child Plan
</h2>
<ul>
<li>A child plan provides the double benefit and serves as both an insurance product and also an investment tool that aims to provide financial security at important stages of a child&rsquo;s life. </li>
<li>This plan can be purchased by a parent with the child as a nominee. The insurance component in the plan makes sure that the child or the nominee receives a substantial amount of money in case of any unfortunate event with the insured. </li>
<li>The Child Plan provides a lump sum payment on maturity of the plan that can be used to cover important expenses like higher education or marriage. </li>
<li>Whereas the investment component on the other side keeps growing as your child grows and saves a substantial amount of funds that are made available to the child at regular intervals at important stages of life including education, marriage etc. </li>
<li>The plan provides guaranteed returns irrespective of the fact whether the policyholder outlives the term or passes away during the term. </li>
<li>When the child's future ensures guaranteed financial stability, the parents can be at ease and can focus on other needs for their child&rsquo;s development. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The best gift a parent can give to their child is a well thought Child Plan that will help them achieve their dreams. <br>

Tips to Purchase the Best Plan
</h2>
<p>We want the best for our customers so here are a few tips to follow while purchasing a plan that will help you get the maximum benefits.</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1 ">
<div class="helement">
<h3>Be an Early Bird while Investing<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>Early investment is the best way to accumulate enough funds for your future. Your child will receive the maturity benefits when they turn 18, and the payouts are available at key milestones. The investment can start as early as your child is born, or at the maximum when they are 5 years old. An early start will provide a substantial amount of corpus in hand by the time they are ready for higher studies or any courses abroad, which come at a very high cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h3>Consider the Rising Inflation<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>By the time your child is all grown up and ready for higher education or other important steps in life, say around 10-15 years down the line, the costs of living will certainly be much higher than today. Let us assume that your child will be ready for medical studies in 15 years, so the investment should be planned based on the rising inflation in 15 years and the estimated cost of medical studies at that time. So choosing a higher sum assured plan is the best way to equate the inflation amount a decade later.</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h3>Read Through the Terms and Conditions of Child Plan<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
