If you fail to disclose it, then it means you are violating one of the important terms and conditions of the health insurance company and in case of investigation this could be counted as misrepresentation.<br/><br/> Let’s understand the claim procedure by taking into account different scenarios.<br/><br/> Scenario 1: When total claim amount is less than the sum assured under a single policy In case of indemnity policies like mediclaim or hospital reimbursement type insurance, if the insured opts for multiple policies in the same tenure and the claim amount is less than the sum assured, then insured has all rights to choose from which insurer he wants to make a claim. For instance, Mr. Sharma has Rs 4 lakh insurance policy from Insurer X and Rs 2 lakh policy from Insurer Y. The claim amount is Rs 2 lakh. In this case, the insured can choose any insurance company who will be bound to settle the claim as per terms and conditions.<br/><br/> Scenario 2: When claim amount is more than the sum assured under a single policy In this case, insured has all rights to choose the insurer who will settle claims. However, if at the time of a claim settlement, insured doesn’t disclose about other policies, then the insurer’s liability is restricted up to the sum assured and the policyholder will have to bear remaining expenses.<br/><br/> Scenario 3: Claim under defined benefit policies If the insured has got defined benefits like critical illness where claim doesn’t have any relation with the treatment cost and the payable amount is fixed, then insured will be entitled to get benefits from all policies.<br/><br/> Here the real mantra is to make a claim under the old policies wherein insurance has past the waiting period for a lot of ailments.
