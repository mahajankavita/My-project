<h2>
Understanding Term Insurance
</h2>
<p>
Term insurance is a type of life insurance where the policyholder gets coverage for a specific period by paying premiums regularly. In case of any unfortunate event like the demise of the policyholder when the policy is still active then the sum assured or the death benefit will be passed on to the policy nominee. The term insurance provides higher attractive coverage at a lower premium rate, making it a very popular plan.
</p>
<p>
For example, if Mr Rex has insured himself for 40 years and if he dies in the 37th year, then his beneficiary will get the death benefit as per the policy terms.
</p>
<p>If the person is the sole bread earner of the family, unfortunate events like death can hit hard on the financial status of the family which is why term insurance is necessary. The term insurance can provide some income during the time of crisis.</p>

</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Offers Great Tax Benefits </a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
Avail tax benefits of Term insurance plans. Tax benefits can be availed under various Sections as per the Income Tax Acts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 80 C: Section 80C allows a tax deduction of up to 1.5 lakh per annum for term life insurance premiums.</li>
<li>Section 10(10D)D: According to Section 10(10D) if the policyholder dies the beneficiary who gains the death benefit is completely tax-free. According to the tax laws Section 10(10D), the insurance benefits obtained by the nominee are fully exempt from taxes. </li>
<li>Section 80D: Under this Section, 80D the insured avails a tax benefit to the premium paid for health-related coverage plans. These coverage plans include Critical Illness Rider, Hospital Care Rider, Surgical Care Rider, etc., which acts as an add-on coverage in term insurance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Critical Illness Covered in Term Insurance </a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
The term plan not only offers a life cover but also protection against critical illness. A small amount goes for an add-on to avail of this critical illness benefit. If the policyholder is diagnosed with any critical illness like kidney failure, heart attack, cancer, etc., then the insurance company provides a lump sum amount to the insured. Protecting Your Liabilities:<br>
The term insurance also safeguards your liabilities like a car loan, house loan etc. In case of an insured person’s demise, the term insurance will support the family financially by replacing the insured person income.
</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Premium Payments are Flexible</a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
 <p>
The term insurance can either be paid in a single premium payment or you can on a monthly, semi-annual or yearly basis.
</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Riders Benefit Covered</a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
The add on benefit also covers in case of accidental death or accidental disability wherein an additional sum insured is provided. This benefit can be availed by paying a small add on premium with the regular premium.
</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Death Benefit</a>

</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Maturity Benefit </a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
A normal term insurance plan does not provide any benefits on the maturity of the insurance policy. However, now several insurance companies have tweaked the term plans to provide some maturity benefits. These plans on maturity would pay you back the entire premium amounts if the insurer sees through the policy term. This benefit can be availed as an add-on feature called the TROP or Term Return of Premium.

<h2>
Who Should Buy Term Insurance?
</h2>
<p>
Let us take an example and compare two scenarios to understand the concept better.<br>
There are two people in this scenario <strong>Mr A</strong> and <strong>Mr B.</strong> Now <strong>
Mr A
has two retired parents, has a spouse who is a housewife and also has two children.
</strong> He is the only bread
earner in the family and the family is dependent on his income. He has a lot of responsibilities including
a home loan of 80 lakh rupees.<br>
<strong>Mr B. is alone, is not married</strong>, and has parents who are not dependent on him.
He also has a good income of more than 2 lakh per month.
<br>
Now, who do you think requires term insurance.
It is <strong class="text-blue">Mr A who has more responsibilities and need life protection</strong>,
with affordable premiums and also a tax saver plan.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The person who is the <span>sole source of income in the family must have insurance.</span>
Parents who have dependent children must have term insurance since the children's educational
needs are fulfilled by the parents. It is important to get insured in case of any mishap of the
parents the insurance policy will payout a lump sum amount or as an income to protect the children
financially during the crisis</li>
<li>A person <span>who does not have any investments</span> or corpus must have a term insurance</li>
<li>
A person <span>who has liabilities such as a home loan or car loan, etc.</span>, must have term insurance as it will protect such liabilities.
</li>
<li><span>Married couples should get insurance</span> since the spouse will be dependent on her husband's income. By taking the insurance it will secure her future</li>
<li>In case a woman is the sole source of income in the family she will have lots of responsibilities that
can be taken care of by taking insurance. This will ensure that the family continues to live in peace
even in the absence of the insured person</li>
<li><span>Retired people</span> also need term insurance if the <span>wife and children are still dependent</span> on them.</li>
<li>If a person <span>wishes to save taxes</span> then this is the best option as it saves tax and also provides other benefits. The premium amount paid is exempt from tax under Section 80 C.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="sectiontitle">Timing - sooner the better </h5>
<h2>
What Is The Right Time to Buy Term Insurance?
</h2>
<p>
It is best to purchase the insurance as early as possible as the premium
amount will be lesser. Once you grow older in your life maybe 40 - 45 years
people might start getting attracted to certain lifestyle diseases or
age-related diseases. In this case, your amount of premium will be higher.
So it is necessary to be insured as early as possible when you are healthy,
fit and fine so that the premium amount will be lower. This will provide
extensive coverage and financial stability to your family and dependants at
an early age.
</p>
<h3>
Why Having Insurance at an Early Age Is Important?
</h3>
<p>
Let us understand this concept better with an example. Assume that you are 20
years old and you purchased term insurance at this age and your premium
amount is Rs. X. You have insured yourself for 30 years until the age of 60.
The premium amount at the age of 20 and your premium amount at the age of 60
will remain the same. That is why it is better to be an early bird.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="sectiontitle">choose wisely </h5>
<h2>
How Much Insurance Cover Should You Opt For?
</h2>
<p>
There is no hard and fast rule that this should be the exact amount as the insurance cover, but as a thumb rule, on average it should be a minimum of 10 times your annual income. So for example, if you earn RS. 10 lakh per annum then your insurance cover should be a minimum of Rs. 1 crore. And the optimal insurance cover could be 15 to 20 times your annual income.
To dive deep into the topic we need to understand the factors required to calculate the amount of insurance coverage that an individual may require.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Based on Monthly Income</h3>
<p>
The insurance amount is purchased to replace the income of the breadwinner of the family in case of an unfortunate mishap. So the amount of insurance cover is calculated based on the monthly income of the policyholder. For example, if a person earns Rs. 10 lakh per annum then the insurance cover is calculated as 10 lakh * 20= Rs. 2,00,00,000. So in absence of the policyholder, the nominee will receive this amount as a monthly payout in replacement to the policyholder's income.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Based on HLV</h3>
<p>
This calculation is based on the Human Life Value which tells the present value of future expenses, liabilities and other investments. The HLV is calculated to determine how much money you require to secure the financial status of your dependents with term insurance coverage in your absence. The HLV takes into account various factors like occupation, age, gender, retirement age, expenses, investments, income, etc, to determine the insurance coverage amount.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Based On The Assets And Liabilities</h3>
<p>
To calculate the sum assured it is important to consider the present and future loans of a person like car loans, house loans, educational loans, and EMI of the person.

<h2>
Types of Term Insurance Plans
</h2>
<p>
Term insurance plans are classified into 6 different types based on the sum assured coverage and the benefits they provide.
</p>
<div class="accordianarea">
<a class="accordion cmdiv ">Level Term Plan </a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv ">
<p>It is the basic and traditional type of term plan that one can buy. Here the sum assured is fixed and the policyholder has to pay the premium amount for the entire term of the plan. If the policyholder dies before the completion of the policy tenure, then the nominee will receive the entire sum assured.</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Term Return of Premium Plan (TROP) </a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv ">
<p>
Unlike the traditional term insurance plan, this Plan comes with maturity benefits wherein the policyholder receives the money if he/she survives the policy tenure. This plan is widely popular but it costs a little extra premium.
</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Decreasing Term Insurance</a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>In this term plan, the premium amount is low as the sum assured keeps decreasing with every passing year. This type of plan is bought if the policyholder has taken huge debts. As years pass by the debts get paid off from the policyholder's income, hence the need for sum assured keeps decreasing. In case of any unfortunate event such as the death of the policyholder during the policy tenure, then the insurance money is passed on to the nominee who can use the sum assured to pay off the debts.</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Increasing Term Insurance</a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
Unlike the decreasing plan, this pan is quite opposite where the sum assured keeps increasing every year. This type of insurance plan is useful for larger future expenses like marriages and higher studies. The insured person can increase the sum assured annually during the policy period, but the premium amount may or may not vary based on the type of insurance company.
</p>
</div>
<a class="accordion cmdiv">Convertible Plan</a>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
This is a type of plan that allows the policyholder the option to convert their basic term insurance into any type of plan in the future. The policyholder can change their term plan into a whole life insurance plan or invest in an endowment policy, after spending a stipulated amount of time.

<h5 class="sectiontitle">Factors Affecting </h5>
<h2>
Term Insurance Premiums
</h2>
<p>Various factors affect the term insurance premium amount.</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1">
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>The Policy Tenure</h3>
<p>
is the number of years for which a person will remain covered. <span>
Longer tenure results in higher
premium
</span> which is more beneficial & economical since you are paying it for
a long time. Shorter-term plans might seem cheaper, but they have less benefits.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Sum Assured</h3>
<p>
The sum assured is the total value of the insurance policy at the time of purchase.
It is the amount paid by the insurer to the nominee under unfortunate events like death.
Policy with a <span>higher sum assured will have a higher premium.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Add-ons or Additional Riders </h3>
<p>

A pure and standard term insurance policy offers only the sum assured.
But additional features Like waiver of premium, accidental cover,
critical illness cover, permanent total disability cover, income protection benefit etc.
can be added as add-ons. <span>Having add-ons will cost you a higher premium.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box">
<h3>Age of the Insured</h3>
<p>
Age is an important factor affecting term insurance premiums. The <span>
younger you are the premium amount
will be lower.
</span> As the age increases the premium amount starts rising.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>Gender of the Insured Person</h3>
<p>
The gender of a person also affects the premium. Insurance companies have placed a criterion wherein
the <span>females are charged a much lesser premium than males.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>Smoking and Drug Abuse</h3>
<p>
Certain lifestyle habits like smoking, use of tobacco products, excessive alcohol drinking,
drug abuse decreases the life span of a person. These habits can lead to a <span>higher premium amount</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>Personal & Family Health Status</h3>
<p>
Your <span>health condition can affect the premium amount.</span> A person with medical history will be charged a
higher premium than a healthy person with no ailments. Any pre-existing diseases like diabetes, obesity,
blood pressure, asthma, etc, will affect the premium rates. Family medical history is also considered a
premium affecting factor. Sometimes an insurance company takes into account certain family hereditary
diseases like diabetes, heart problems, cancer, etc.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>Payment Type During the Claim</h3>
<p>
Another factor is the payment type. There are two types of sum assured payment options for a
policyholder one is a lump sum one-time payment and the other option is dispersing the amount and
getting paid on a monthly or yearly basis. This type of plan will turn out to be like a stream of
income for the beneficiary.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>Occupation of the Insured:</h3>
<p>
Occupation of a person also affects the term insurance premium of the insured person.
If the <span>nature of the job is too risky then the insurance premiums will be higher.</span>

<h3>
Additional Documents
</h3>
<p>Depending on the insurance company and the type of term insurance plan taken the insurer might ask for some additional documents like medical reports. If you have undergone any surgery or underwent any medical procedures in the last few years then the insurer might ask to submit the medical records, diagnosis document, discharge letter.</p>
<p>Some insurance companies might ask to take a Full Medical Examination before issuing the policy. In this case, the insurance company will fix an appointment with the hospital at your convenience and take care of the medical expenses. The medical report will be directly sent to the insurance company.</p>
<p>The documentation process is very important and should be very precise. It is necessary to disclose every minute detail about your health because 2% of claim applicants are rejected every year due to information mismatch. Clarify any doubts directly with the insurance company to avoid confusion.</p>

<h5 class="sectiontitle"> Understanding the working</h5>
<h2>
How does a Term Insurance Plan Work?
</h2>
<ul>
<li> Once you purchase a term insurance plan the insurance provider gets into an agreement with the policyholder</li>
<li> In case of the unfortunate demise of the policyholder during the tenure, the insurance provider pays the death benefit to the beneficiary as mentioned in the policy document</li>
<li> The type of payout option is chosen by the policyholder at the time of purchasing the policy</li>
</ul>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12 fh5co-section-heading  ">
<h3>Payout Options:</h3>
<p>There are 3 types of payout options available in the term plan. You can choose your convenient type.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Lump-Sum - </span> Here the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary at a single lump-sum payment</li>
<li><span>Lump-Sum with Monthly Payment - </span> Here half of the sum assured is paid as lump-sum and the other half is paid as monthly income regularly</li>
<li>
<span>Monthly Income - </span> Here the death benefit is received as a regular monthly income from the first month of the claim being made
</li>
</ol>
