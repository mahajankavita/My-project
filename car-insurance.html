<h3>What is Car Insurance?<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>
Car insurance is a form of agreement or contract between the car owner and the insurance provider where the car owner will pay a certain amount as an insurance premium and the insurer will pay for any damage or loss caused to the car. The car insurance covers your car against financial losses that you may face in case of an accident, theft of the car, damages to the insured car or third party person or property. As per IRDA&nbsp;<strong>(Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority),</strong>&nbsp;all motor vehicles in India must be covered under an active&nbsp;<strong><em>car insurance policy</em></strong>. Most of the car dealers have to tie up with the insurance companies and provide instant insurance to their customers who purchase a car in their showroom. <br>
<strong>Based on the policy type and add-ons you opt for, your car insurance policy may have the following benefits:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Liability Cover </li>
<li>Invoice Cover </li>
<li>Engine Protector </li>
<li>Tyre Cover </li>
<li>Electrical Accessories </li>
<li>PA For Unnamed Passenger </li>
<li>Consumable Cover </li>
<li>24*7 Roadside Assistance </li>
<li>No Claim Bonus </li>
<li>Key &amp; Lock Replacement </li>
<li>Non-Electrical Accessories </li>

<h3>
5 Reasons Why you Need Car Insurance?<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Having car insurance is mandatory in every state. It is an offence against the law to drive a car without insurance.</li>
<li>It provides financial protection by covering your vehicle against damages due to accidents, natural calamities, man-made disasters, or in-transit damages.</li>
<li>It reduces your liabilities by covering the insured against legal liability to a third party in an accident, or third party injuries, damage to the third party property and even death of the third party due to the accident.</li>
<li>The insurance provides personal accidental cover to the owner of the vehicle that will get him covered for accidental injuries or death. It also covers the passenger's medical expenses due to the accident.</li>
<li>It will cover for the damage caused by theft or fire.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="smsection1">
<h3>
What Will Happen If You Do Not Have Car Insurance?<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h3>
<p>Let us assume that you accidentally hit a car parked on the roadside and caused damage to your own car as well as the third party&rsquo;s car. This will come under third-party property damage and personal accident cover. Thankfully you have car insurance which will cover the expenses for the third-party damage and personal car damage. But if you do not have car insurance or have failed to renew your car insurance on time then you might face some serious consequences like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your driving license will get suspended</li>
<li>The cost of the damage could leave you debted </li>
<li>You will face legal proceedings and punishment</li>
<li>Your car registration will be suspended</li>
<li>You will be charged a fine for driving without an insurance</li>

<h5 class=" sectiontitle "> How It Works</h5>
<h2>
Understanding the Working of Car Insurance
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Car insurance</em></strong>&nbsp;premiums will differ based on various factors like the brand and model of the car.
You can choose third party car insurance or a comprehensive car policy based on your need.
</li>
<li>
The most popular type of plan that is preferred is the<strong> comprehensive policy</strong>. It is a wholesome package that has different types of features
(add-ons) like <strong>liability cover, accident cover, invoice cover, consumables cover, engine cover etc.</strong>
</li>
<li>
While buying car insurance, you are required to choose a deductible. <strong>A deductible is an amount you are willing to pay, against the losses incurred due to an accident.</strong>
The deductible amount determines the annual premium you will pay for your car insurance, i.e., a higher deductible result in lower premiums.
<br />
If a claim is made the insurance company will pay a part of the losses, while the rest will be paid by you as the deductible amount.
<br />
For example, if your car has to be repaired after an accident and the total expense for the repair is Rs. 20,000 and your chosen deductible is Rs. 5,000. The insurance company will pay Rs. 15,000 and you will pay Rs. 5,000.
<br />
<strong> Choosing a deductible</strong> is an important step while purchasing a car as you will be paying the deductible amount for every situation.
</li>
<li>
In case of an unfortunate grievous situation with your car, you can claim for car insurance and the amount will be reimbursed as per the eligibility mentioned and add-ons attached with your type of policy.
</li>

<h2>
Types of Online Car Insurance Policy
</h2>
<p>
We have seen how car insurance works, but did you know that there are different forms of car insurance in India.
Here is a list of some basic car insurance types, and how they work?
</p>
<ol class="mt-3">
<li>
<h4> Third-Party or Liability Cover </h4>
<p>
Third-party insurance is a common type of insurance
where only the damage and losses caused to a third party vehicle or person
is covered. It is mandatory in India to have a third party insurance cover.
Liability insurance or third party insurance will cover the cost of repairs
for any third party property damaged by an accident as well as the medical
bills for the third party person from resulting injuries.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Collision Cover </h4>
<p>
In case if another vehicle hits your car and is damaged severely, this cover helps to bear the repair expenses. Also, if the damages are quite big and the repair expenses are exceeding the total value of the car, the collision cover pays the value of the car. This cover is useful for expensive high-end cars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Comprehensive Cover</h4>
<p>
Comprehensive coverage provides you with extra coverage that includes all types of damages under all unfortunate situations you may face with your car. It covers accidental damages, medical expenses to self and others, damages faced due to weather, natural calamities, car theft, and vandalism, are also covered. The other two insurances do not offer this coverage. Although it is not mandatory by law to have comprehensive coverage, if it suits your budget, it is one of the most important insurance policies that will give you both third party coverage benefits as well as coverage for your vehicle. It can be further enhanced by adding a rider benefit like NCB (No Claim Bonus), accessories cover, invoice cover etc. Since it has all-inclusive features, this cover comes is expensive than the rest two.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Personal Injury Coverage</h4>
<p>
This cover offer protection to both the owner/driver and the passengers in case of an accident. The medical bills and hospitalization charges for both owner and passenger are covered by the insurance, not considering whose fault it was.
</p>

<h5 class=" sectiontitle ">Riders/Add-on Covers</h5>
<h2>
In Your Car Insurance Policy!
</h2>
<p>
Having an add-on is an additional benefit to your car policy which provides extra coverage to your car against unforeseen expenses. You can buy the riders benefit, by paying an extra premium.
There are several add-on benefits offered by insurance companies, so choose the one according to your specific requirements.
</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1 mt-3">
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Personal Accidental Cover
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
This is an add-on that comes with the comprehensive policy where the coverage is offered to third-party as well as covers against personal accidents. This add-on applies to the owner(if he is driving the car) as well as the paid driver. In case the driver dies or suffers a serious injury in a car accident the insurance company will pay a lump sum amount as compensation to the driver. This add-on is very important and a must-have on your car policy.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Personal Accident Rider/Add-on
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
This feature can be availed with a comprehensive policy by paying an extra premium. This add-on provides coverage to the insured for medical expenses due to accident, personal injury or disability caused due to accident.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Zero Depreciation Benefit
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
Usually, after an accident, some of the car parts need to be changed. But depending on how old the car is, the insurer will pay as per the depreciated value of the spare parts. By taking a zero depreciation you get the insurance claim as per the actual value of spare parts, which helps you save a lot of money on car repair.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Engine Cover
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
The engine is the most important part of your car so it has to be protected from getting damaged by incidents like flooding. A standard policy does not offer engine protection cover and hence getting this add-on will be beneficial. In case your car gets damaged due to floods, the engine cover add-on helps you to bear the engine repair or replacement expenses through your car insurance policy.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Road Assistance
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
If your car is broken down in the middle of the road this add-on cover ensures that the insurance company arranges for your car to be towed away to a garage and help you to reach your destination.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Daily Allowance
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
This is a very interesting add-on wherein you will get a cash allowance in case your car is at a garage for repairs. You can use this cash to arrange for an alternative mode of transport till you get your car back. The allowance is normally given for 10-15 days and the amount ranges from Rs. 500 - Rs.1000 that depends on the model of the car.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Lock And Key Replacement Benefit
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
If you lose your car keys and require a new key and lock, this add-on will help you to get the actual cost of it.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Consumables Cover
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
This cover can be purchased if your car is not older than three years. This add-on can be used to claim for any money spent on nuts & bolts, screen washers, engine oil, bearings and other consumable parts when your car meets with an accident. This benefit is not covered in a standard car policy.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
Return to Invoice Cover
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
The Insured Declared Value (IDV) or current market value determines the value of your car which is usually lower than the actual value of the car. In case of loss or damage to the car due to accident or theft, the insurance company will pay you the claim as per IDV. But, if you take the Return On Invoice add-on, you can get the actual value of your car without deducting the registration charges, road tax and any depreciation calculated on it.
</div>
<div class="helement mb-3">
<h4>
No Claim Bonus (NCB) Cover
<div class="border-rw"></div>
</h4>
<p>
No Claim Bonus is a benefit that is offered in all car insurance policies. If you do not file for any insurance claim throughout the year, then you are eligible for no claim bonus. You can avail of this benefit in the form of discounts on premiums for your next policies. For example, if you get 20% NCB then you get a discount on the premium for your next policy after a claim-free year. The NCB can go up to 50% if no claim is made for 5 continuous years. In case, you file a claim due to an unforeseen event, then your NCB will become zero. But if you get an NCB cover add-on in your policy, you can keep your bonus intact and claim insurance.
</p>
<p>All of the above add-ons are optional, but they can be very useful in certain situations. Keeping in view your actual needs, you can opt for some benefits or all of them.</p>

<h5 class=" sectiontitle ">Parameters to Choose</h5>
<h2>
The Best Car Insurance Company
</h2>
<p>Several parameters have to be considered before purchasing the best car insurance company. Each person has different needs and depending on their requirements the car insurance company has to be selected.</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1">
<div class="helement help-box ">
<h3>1.	Claim Settlement Ratio<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>
Claim settlement ratio (CSR) and incurred claim ratio (ICR) has to be considered while purchasing a plan. The claim settlement ratio refers to the total percentage of a claim settled by the insurance company. ICR or incurred claim ratio refers to the total percentage of premium that has been utilised by the insurance company from the total percentage of premium collected by them. A company with higher CSR and ICR is considered to be a good pick.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement  help-box ">
<h3>2.	Cashless Garage Network<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>
A cashless garage is a useful feature in case of emergencies. We should look for insurance companies that have a strong network of cashless garage facilities.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement  help-box ">
<h3>
3.	Add-on Features
<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>

</p>
</div>
<div class="helement  help-box ">
<h3>4.	Good Customer Support Service<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>
Some companies offer 24*7 customer support and other’s may offer 5-day customer assistance. The availability and quality of the customer service have to be checked. This can be checked based on customer reviews.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement  help-box ">
<h3>5.	Financial Background of the Company<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>
The financial ability of the company is important that determines how quick the company will settle your claim amount when you need it. This can be checked by going through the company’s annual financial records and its solvency ratio.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement  help-box ">

<h4>You Fulfill Legal Requirements</h4>

</div>
<div class="helement">

In case your car meets with an accident, and has caused damage to the car then you can simply claim insurance and bear the expenses without spending loads of money from your pocket.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h4>Having a Third-Party Cover is Important</h4>
<p>
In case you cause damage to another person's car or if the driver gets hurt, you can bear the damage expenses by claiming your third party insurance, which covers hospitalization and legal expenses too.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h4>Damage to Car Due to Natural Calamities</h4>
<p>
If your car is damaged due to natural calamities like fire, flood or earthquake, then your car insurance policy will come in handy to claim for the damages.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h4>Loss due to Theft and Vandalism</h4>
<p>
If you have comprehensive car insurance it will provide you with cover against theft and vandalism. You can also claim insurance if your car gets stolen.
</p>
</div>
<div class="helement">
<h4>No Claim Bonus Benefit</h4>
<p>
If you do not make any car insurance claims throughout the year, then you are eligible to get a handsome no claim bonus(NCB). Your next online car insurance premium comes cheaper to you.<br>
You must buy a comprehensive car policy at the earliest and if you already have insurance coverage, get it renewed on time by easily comparing various policies at insurejoy.com and remain tension free!

<h5 class=" sectiontitle ">Factors That Affect</h5>
<h2>
Your Car Insurance Premium
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Some important factors that affect car insurance are:</strong>
</p>
<div class="accordianarea">
<button class="accordion cmdiv"> Age and Gender</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
The premiums are higher for age groups from 18-25 years, since the probability of accidents is higher for these age groups, as per the insurance statistics.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv"> Anti-theft Safety Discount</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
If your car is fitted with an ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) approved anti-theft device, you are eligible to enjoy an additional discount of 2.5%. Enjoy lower premiums for staying safe and secured.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv">Type of Fuel Used for Your Car</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
An insured person who has a petrol car will pay a lower premium, but if you drive a CNG, the insurance comes at a higher premium, because the chances of unforeseen damage are higher.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv"> Car Model and Variant</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
If you own high-end car models, such as Bentley, Audi or BMW, the premiums for such cars are higher. The reason for higher premiums is because the theft rates for expensive cars are higher, the value of the car is much higher and the damage cost is also quite costly.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv">No Claim Bonus (NCB)</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
If you did not make any car insurance claims throughout the year then you are eligible for NCB or No Claim Bonus. It varies from 10% to 50% discount on premium, depending upon the number of claim-less years. The NCB can be transferred to another policy.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv">Premiums vary for Urban and Rural Area</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
The premium for urban areas than the rural area because the chances of accidents are higher than scarcely populated areas.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv">Car Make/Year of Manufacture/IDV</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
If your car is older the premiums are lesser if you own a new car then the premium is higher. The year of manufacture of your car directly affects the IDV (Insured Declared Value) of your car. The IDV value decreases for an older car which is calculated as per the current market value of the car. If the IDV is less, the premium rates also decrease.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion cmdiv">Additional Discounts Based On Profession</button>
<div class="panelnew cmdiv">
<p>
If the insured person belongs to the category of defence personnel, doctors, government employees, or police force, then the person is eligible to get an additional discount on the premium.
At insurejoy.com, you can key in all the factors and reach the best premium value as per your needs, in just a few clicks!

<h2>
Car Insurance Online Renewal Process
</h2>
<p>Car Insurance Renewal is one of the most important processes that have to be done every year before the due date. It is quite easy to renew your car insurance at insurejoy.com.</p>
<p>
In case you forget to renew on time and your car insurance policy has expired or is about to expire, then it is very simple to get it renewed at your insurer's website or insurejoy.com. You can switch to another insurer or keep renewing your policy with the same insurer, either way, both will be hassle-free and simple processes. The policy has to be renewed within the expiry date or the grace period. <br>
</p> <p>Now let us run through the important points involved in renewing car insurance online</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1">
<div class="felement mt-2 mb-2">
<h3>Renew your policy within the Grace Period<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<p>Some insurance providers offer a <strong> grace period that allows you a time of 15 to 30
days after your policy has been expired.</strong> The grace period depends on the terms and conditions of the
insurance company. Some insurance companies allow you to get it renewed even after the grace
period but you will pay additional costs. Do not use your grace period very often use it only
when you need it. Some insurers may charge a late fee for using the grace period.
<br /><br />
Not every insurance companies offer a grace period. Make sure at the time of buying the policy,
whether you are entitled to have a grace period. Even if you have missed renewing
your policy before expiry or within the grace period, you can still
get it renewed, but the process will be tedious and will need more effort and money.</p>
</div>
<div class="felement mt-2 mb-2">
<h3><span>Renew Before the Expiry Date </span><div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to renew offline then get in touch with your insurance provider and ask them for the&nbsp;<strong><em>documents for car insurance renewal</em></strong>. The concerned agent will visit you and help you with the renewal process. </li>
<li>But it is best to get our policy renewed by visiting the insurance provider's website and go for online renewal, saving a lot of time and effort. </li>

<li>Choose the add-ons or benefits if necessary. </li>
<li>You will get instant quotes after entering the details. If you are happy with the quote go ahead and make payment and get your car insurance policy renewed in no time. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="felement mt-2 mb-2">
<h3>Renewing After the Grace Period<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>

<ul>
<li>Higher Premiums </li>
<li>Loss of previous benefits </li>

<h2>
How To Claim Your Car Insurance!
</h2>
<p>Let us discuss the steps involved Here on how to claim your car insurance, in any of the following scenarios.</p>
<div class="elementcontainer1">
<div class="felement">
<h3>In case of a car accident!<div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep your insurance policy active by renewing it on time. This is the most important step that will help you to get the claim amount. </li>
<li>Immediately after accidental damage take pictures of the damage that is done. The pictures have to be taken in both cases, if the accident was your mistake, or someone else caused the damage. </li>
<li>Call the cops to the accident zone. This step is of utmost importance to activate the legal process immediately. This will help at the time of filing for claims. The cops will inspect the vehicle and take note of the accident scene. </li>
<li>If the other person has not run away from the accident scene, try getting the details of the other vehicle like the model number, vehicle number, make of the car and more such details. </li>
<li>Filing an FIR is mandatory in the case of third-party liability claims. Without an FIR making a claim will be very difficult for you. </li>
<li>Call your concerned insurance company as soon as possible. </li>
<li>You can proceed with the claim process with the help of the representative regarding forms or documents that will be required to support your claim. </li>
<li>The insurance company will ask for a &quot;proof of damage&quot; form as well as records relating to your claim (such as medical bills, car repair bills and a copy of the FIR). </li>
<li>Submitting correct and validated information to the representative is the right thing to do for claiming the insurance. </li>
<li>Inspection officials will inspect and evaluate the vehicle. The damaged car will be inspected and verified by examining the evidence of any injury claims, and initial payment. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="felement">
<h3>In case of a car theft! <div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<ol>
<li>The immediate step would be to lodge a complaint at the nearest police station and file an FIR. </li>
<li>Next, make a call to your insurance provider office and inform them about the theft. </li>
<li>Also, make a call to the RTO (Road Transport Office) and inform them about the theft. </li>
<li>Your insurance company will provide a claim form that has to be filled by providing information such as policy number, vehicle registration number, RC number, date time and a brief description of the theft incident that took place </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="felement">
<h3>Document to be submitted to your insurance provider <div class="border-rw"></div></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Duly Signed Claim Form </li>
<li>The Original Copy of the FIR </li>
<li>Copy of The Policy Documents </li>
<li>A Copy of The Driving License </li>
<li>The Original Keys of The Car </li>
<li>Copy of the letter addressed to the RTO intimating theft </li>
<li>Copy of The Vehicle&rsquo;s RC </li>
<li>RTO transfer papers have to be duly signed along with the necessary forms such as (Form 28, 29, 30 and 35). </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the local police station submits the no-trace report which means the vehicle could not be found, the claim will be approved. Now transfer the RC of the stolen car in favour of the insurance company and hand over all sets of keys and issue a letter of subrogation to the&nbsp;<strong><em>insurance company</em></strong>. Although filing a car insurance claim is easy and simple, it is important to do it properly or else the claim can become null and void. </p>
